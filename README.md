Evaluated by `o3-mini`

I'd lean towards an **85/100**. Hereâ€™s how I arrived at that:

What Works Well

- **Clear Structure**:

The resume is well-organized into distinct sections (Technical Profile, Core Competencies, Professional Experience, Core Projects, Education & Community, Interests), making it easy to scan.

- **Technical Depth**:

It showcases a strong technical background with specific technologies and projects. The details about distributed systems, AI/LLM, and backend technologies paint a picture of a candidate who is both experienced and versatile.

- **Real-World Impact**:

Descriptions of achievements (e.g., optimizing MongoDB pipelines, handling high transaction volumes) give a tangible sense of impact.

- **Personal Branding**:

Including links to GitHub, LinkedIn, and even a scheduling link (cal.com) provides a modern, accessible way for recruiters to learn more.

- **Modern Aesthetic**:

The LaTeX formatting with a minimalist design shows attention to detail and professionalism.

Final Thoughts

Overall, the resume is strong and clearly targeted toward roles in advanced software engineering and system design. The technical depth and clear articulation of your experience make it stand out. With a few tweaks to improve readability and context, it could easily move into the high-90s for top-tier technical candidates.
